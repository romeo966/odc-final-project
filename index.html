				The Causes of Lassa Fever  on Phebe Airstrip Community, Suakoko District, Bong County, Republic of Liberia
			</h3>
			
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>
					This work cover all of my research report from zone one (1), zone two (2), Zone #3 and Zone#4 on the topics:lassa fever. looking above is a pictures that shows what is really causing this fever in this part of the Country and if Awareness is not done many lives will be endanger which will actually bad for the citizens that are residing in this part of the country. On July 4,2024. I arrived at the phebe Airstrip Community at 10: 45Am. Upon arrival, I met the town Chief in person of Mr. Abraham Kollie,I did introduce myself and explained the purpose of my visit. Mr. Kollie was happy and he welcomed me and granted me the permission to start my work. He pointed out some area that i should focus which were the above mention zones. he told me that, both zone 1 and 2 are using only one hand pump, and also show me where those people throw their dirt. He also told me that this Fever is causing serious harm for the Children and people of Phebe Airstrip Community and other nearby Town and Villages. During this rese					arch I observed some parts of the Phebe Airstrip Community very dirty and nasty, people throwing dirt at the back of their houses, Grass all around their home and some family even used the back of the house for latrine which was actually wrong and unhealthful for Citizens that are residing in that part of the county. I was able to educate few individuals in zone one(1) zone two(2), Zone Three(3) and Zone Four(4) communities including teenagers (11-17) years, early adults (18-30)years and older adults (30-70) years old, consisting of males and females on the this lassa fever and what this fever is capable of doing to the entire Community and other nearby communities if proper care is not taken
